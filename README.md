# Ansible Role: Nginx

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-nginx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-nginx)

Installs Nginx on RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu linux servers.

This role installs and configures the latest version of Nginx from the Nginx yum repository (on RedHat-based systems) or via apt (on Debian-based systems). You will likely need to do extra setup work after this role has installed Nginx, like adding your own [virtualhost].conf file inside `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`, describing the location and options to use for your particular website.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    nginx_vhosts: []

A list of vhost definitions (server blocks) for Nginx virtual hosts. If left empty, you will need to supply your own virtual host configuration. See the commented example in `defaults/main.yml` for available server options. If you have a large number of customizations required for your server definition(s), you're likely better off managing the vhost configuration file yourself, leaving this variable set to `[]`.

    nginx_remove_default_vhost: false

Whether to remove the 'default' virtualhost configuration supplied by Nginx. Useful if you want the base `/` URL to be directed at one of your own virtual hosts configured in a separate .conf file.

    nginx_upstreams: []

If you are configuring Nginx as a load balancer, you can define one or more upstream sets using this variable. In addition to defining at least one upstream, you would need to configure one of your server blocks to proxy requests through the defined upstream (e.g. `proxy_pass http://myapp1;`). See the commented example in `defaults/main.yml` for more information.

    nginx_user: "nginx"

The user under which Nginx will run. Defaults to `nginx` for RedHat, and `www-data` for Debian.

    nginx_worker_processes: "1"
    nginx_worker_connections: "8192"

`nginx_worker_processes` should be set to the number of cores present on your machine. Connections (find this number with `grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l`). `nginx_worker_connections` is the number of connections per process. Set this higher to handle more simultaneous connections (and remember that a connection will be used for as long as the keepalive timeout duration for every client!).

    nginx_client_max_body_size: "64m"

This value determines the largest file upload possible, as uploads are passed through Nginx before hitting a backend like `php-fpm`. If you get an error like `client intended to send too large body`, it means this value is set too low.

    nginx_keepalive_timeout: "65"

The keepalive timeout. Should be set higher (10s+) if you have more polling-style traffic (AJAX-powered sites especially), or lower (<10s) if you have a site where most users visit a few pages and don't send any further requests.

    nginx_proxy_cache_path: ""

Set as the `proxy_cache_path` directive in the `nginx.conf` file. By default, this will not be configured (if left as an empty string), but if you wish to use Nginx as a reverse proxy, you can set this to a valid value (e.g. `"/var/cache/nginx keys_zone=cache:32m"`) to use Nginx's cache (further proxy configuration can be done in individual server configurations).

## Dependencies

None.
